# Feature: First-launch Setup Wizard

> Last updated: 2026-04-24

## Context

A fresh Picsou install used to require hand-editing `.env` with 13+ values — including
`openssl rand` runs and PKCS8 key juggling — and a malformed `APP_PASSWORD_HASH` hard-
failed Spring at startup with an unfriendly stack trace. The wizard replaces all of that
with a guided, web-based flow the first time the app is opened.

## How it works

The bootstrap runs on two levels.

- **Invisible (Docker entrypoint)** auto-generates `JWT_SECRET`, `CRYPTO_ENCRYPTION_KEY`,
  `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` into `/data/.secrets/` when the corresponding env vars are unset.
  This happens before `supervisord` starts Spring, because those three secrets are
  consumed by bean constructors (`JwtUtil`, `CryptoEncryption`) and by Flyway before any
  DB-backed config is available.
- **Visible (web wizard)** is served at `/setup` while `setup.state != COMPLETE`. It
  walks the user through: admin account → CORS & secure cookies → integration picker →
  per-integration sub-flows → Done (with confetti + auto-login).

`SetupFilter` short-circuits every non-setup request with `503 setup_required` before
setup is complete, and with `410 Gone` after — so a stale browser tab can never re-POST
admin creation.

### Key files

Backend:
- `backend/src/main/java/com/picsou/controller/SetupController.java` — all `/api/setup/*`
  endpoints (public, rate-limited by Bucket4j).
- `backend/src/main/java/com/picsou/service/SetupService.java` — state-machine
  transitions (`PENDING_ADMIN → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETE`) and admin seeding.
- `backend/src/main/java/com/picsou/service/SetupAuditService.java` — append-only
  `setup_audit` table writes; swallows its own errors so audit failure never blocks a
  controller response.
- `backend/src/main/java/com/picsou/service/EnableBankingKeyPairService.java` —
  idempotent RSA-2048 PEM generation at `/data/keys/enablebanking-private.pem` (POSIX
  `0600`).
- `backend/src/main/java/com/picsou/service/CryptoKeyGeneratorService.java` —
  idempotent AES-256 key writer at `/data/.secrets/crypto_key`. Same path as the Docker
  entrypoint, so whichever runs first wins and the other no-ops.
- `backend/src/main/java/com/picsou/config/SetupFilter.java` — 503/410 gate.
- `backend/src/main/java/com/picsou/config/DynamicCorsConfigurationSource.java` — reads
  `cors.allowed-origins` from `app_setting` so the wizard's Security step takes effect
  without a container restart.
- `backend/src/main/resources/db/migration/V25__setup_state.sql` — conditional seed:
  `setup.state='COMPLETE'` for existing installs (admin already present), else
  `'PENDING_ADMIN'`.
- `backend/scripts/picsou-init.sh` — bare-metal equivalent of the Docker entrypoint;
  prints an `.env.local` to stdout.

Frontend:
- `frontend/src/pages/setup/SetupLayout.tsx` — the centered hero layout, top progress
  bar, step pill, font preload.
- `frontend/src/pages/setup/HelloGreeting.tsx` — 12-greeting multilingual opener in
  Homemade Apple font, `prefers-reduced-motion` aware.
- `frontend/src/pages/setup/SetupStep{Intro,Admin,Security,Integrations,Complete}.tsx`
  — the main-line steps.
- `frontend/src/pages/setup/integrations/SetupStepEnableBanking.tsx` + 5 substep
  components under `enablebanking/` — the guided EB flow.
- `frontend/src/pages/setup/integrations/SetupStep{BoursoBank,TradeRepublic,Finary,Crypto}.tsx`
  — the other integration substeps.
- `frontend/src/features/setup/{api,hooks,schemas,guards}.tsx` — dedicated axios
  client (no 401 interceptor), react-query hooks, zod schemas, route guards.
- `frontend/src/stores/setup-flow-store.ts` — Zustand (persisted to sessionStorage) for
  selected integrations, EB draft, admin display name.
- `frontend/src/stores/setup-credentials.ts` — in-memory-only admin credentials for
  post-setup auto-login. Deliberately not persisted.

### Flow

```
First boot
    │
    ▼
docker entrypoint.sh  ──► writes /data/.secrets/{jwt_secret,crypto_key,postgres_password}
                              (only if env vars unset — idempotent)
    │
    ▼
Spring boots → Flyway V25 seeds setup.state='PENDING_ADMIN'
    │
    ▼
User opens http://host:8080  ──► RequireSetup redirects /login → /setup
    │
    ▼
Hello greeting → Admin → Security → Integration picker
    │                                    │
    │                                    ├─ Enable Banking: 5 substeps
    │                                    ├─ BoursoBank: sidecar ping
    │                                    ├─ Trade Republic: ack
    │                                    ├─ Finary: ack
    │                                    └─ Crypto: ensure key exists
    │
    ▼
Done → POST /api/setup/complete → auto-login → /
```

## Technical choices

| Choice | Why | Rejected alternative |
|--------|-----|----------------------|
| Two-layer bootstrap (entrypoint + web) | `JWT_SECRET` and `CRYPTO_ENCRYPTION_KEY` are consumed in bean constructors before the DB is available, so they can't live in DB. | Storing every secret in DB (wouldn't boot). |
| `setup.state` as a DB row | Survives container restarts; single source of truth; Flyway can conditionally seed it. | Env var (ephemeral); file on disk (hard to CAS). |
| SERIALIZABLE + CAS on admin creation | Two concurrent POST /admin calls on a fresh install can't both succeed. | Optimistic Hibernate version (doesn't block the second transaction). |
| In-memory stash for auto-login | Password must never hit sessionStorage; refresh loses auto-login but never leaks credentials. | Persisting credentials in the Zustand store. |
| Pure-CSS confetti | Zero new dep, gzip-free celebration, trivial `prefers-reduced-motion` guard. | `canvas-confetti` (~7kB, yet another supply-chain concern). |
| Dedicated axios client for `/api/setup/*` | The main `api` instance has a 401 → refresh → `/login` interceptor that would bounce unauthenticated wizard calls. | Sharing the main client and special-casing 401 (fragile). |
| Idempotent EB keypair | Re-generating the public PEM from an existing private key never invalidates what the user already uploaded to Enable Banking. | Overwriting on every call (silent data loss). |
| Self-hosted Homemade Apple font | Picsou never phones home to fonts.googleapis.com. | Google Fonts CDN link (exfils user IP + user-agent on every fresh install). |
| Nginx-level CSP + security headers | Applies to the index.html that serves the SPA — backend API-only CSP would have no browser effect. | Spring-level CSP (wouldn't apply since SPAs load HTML from nginx). |

## Gotchas / Pitfalls

- **`CryptoKeyGeneratorService` and the Docker entrypoint write to the same path**
  (`/data/.secrets/crypto_key`). If you move one, move both or the app won't boot on a
  fresh install. Covered by
  `CryptoKeyGeneratorServiceTest.ensureKey_isIdempotent_neverOverwritesExistingKey`.
- **V25 migration seeding logic** reads `EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM app_user)` and seeds
  `setup.state='COMPLETE'` for existing installs. If you rename `app_user` don't
  forget this query.
- **`SetupFilter` returns 410 Gone (not 404) after setup completes**, per the plan's
  production-hardening section. The frontend interceptor recognizes both 503 (redirect
  to `/setup`) and 410 (redirect to `/`).
- **`SetupAuditService.record()` swallows its own exceptions**. A DB hiccup during
  audit must never block the controller response — audit is observability, not
  correctness.
- **The EB keypair endpoint is idempotent but the underlying file is the source of
  truth.** Deleting `/data/keys/enablebanking-private.pem` out-of-band and re-running
  the wizard will hand the user a new public PEM and invalidate what they uploaded to
  Enable Banking. A proper key-rotation flow is explicitly out of scope for this
  wizard.
- **Auto-login at the Done screen is best-effort.** If the user refreshes mid-wizard,
  the in-memory credentials are lost and the Done CTA falls back to the login page.
  setup.state is COMPLETE either way; no data is lost.
- **The "pick integrations" step writes nothing to the DB.** Flags only flip when the
  corresponding sub-step completion endpoint is hit (e.g., `/enablebanking/test`
  returning `ok: true`). This is deliberate: ticking EB but then skipping the substeps
  should not leave the app thinking EB is configured.
- **`SetupFilter` must anchor its `addFilterBefore(...)` to a Spring-Security-registered
  filter class (e.g. `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter`), not to a custom one like
  `JwtAuthenticationFilter`.** Passing a custom class as the anchor throws
  `IllegalArgumentException: "... does not have a registered order"` at context-load
  time because Spring Security's `FilterOrderRegistration` only knows the order of its
  own filters. No unit/slice test in the current suite instantiates `SecurityConfig`'s
  real `filterChain` bean, so this class of bug only fails at container boot — verify
  wiring changes with a live `docker compose up`.

## Accessibility

Manually verified for the touched components (no axe-core in CI yet — documented as
future work):

- Every interactive element meets `4.5:1` contrast against its background.
- Full keyboard traversal works on every step (Tab / Shift+Tab / Enter / Space / Esc).
- `role="switch"` on the `IntegrationCard` with `aria-checked`; the whole card is the
  hit target.
- `aria-live="polite"` on the greeting announcer, the integrations-selected counter,
  and the EB test result card.
- `prefers-reduced-motion` honored by: HelloGreeting (collapses to a static render),
  step transitions (`animate-setup-slide-in` → no-op), confetti (pieces hidden).
- Focus rings: every custom button uses `focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-ring`.
- Skip-to-content link at the top of `SetupLayout`.

## Security posture

- **Rate limiting** on `/api/setup/*` via Bucket4j (10 rpm / IP). 429 on breach.
- **Headers** (set by nginx, app-wide):
  `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy:
  strict-origin-when-cross-origin`, `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000;
  includeSubDomains`, `Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()`.
- **CSP** (nginx):
  `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src
  'self' data: https:; font-src 'self'; connect-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'`.
  `'unsafe-inline'` is only in `style-src` because Tailwind's JIT injects inline
  styles; there is no inline script allowance.
- **Audit trail** in the `setup_audit` table for `setup.admin.created`,
  `setup.integration.enabled`, `setup.security.updated`, `setup.completed` — valuable
  forensics for a self-host admin who wants to know "who ran setup on this machine".

## Running without Docker

Bare-metal installs (`mvn spring-boot:run`) need the secrets bootstrap done manually
on first boot:

```bash
./backend/scripts/picsou-init.sh > .env.local
set -a && . .env.local && set +a
mvn -pl backend spring-boot:run
```

The wizard itself works identically — only the secrets-generation step differs.

## Privacy

The wizard makes zero outbound requests on first load:

- Homemade Apple is bundled under `frontend/public/fonts/` — no Google Fonts CDN hit.
- No analytics, no telemetry, no Sentry-style error reporter.
- The only outbound call is the user-initiated "Test connection" for Enable Banking,
  which goes to EB's official API.

## Tests

- `SetupServiceTest` — state transitions (`PENDING_ADMIN → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETE`),
  SERIALIZABLE CAS on admin claim, bcrypt-hash rejection, idempotent seed when user
  already exists, CSV origin persistence, empty-origin rejection, consistent
  integration-key formatting.
- `SetupControllerTest` — endpoint-level: admin seed returns 410 after completion,
  EB keypair regenerate-flag on first call vs. idempotent subsequent calls, EB
  `test` only flips the integration flag on success, BoursoBank health / TR / Finary
  acknowledge flows, crypto-key flagging for existing vs. freshly generated, rate
  limit returns 429 after bucket drain.
- `EnableBankingKeyPairServiceTest` — first-call persistence of private PEM, idempotent
  second call returning the same public half, POSIX 0600 perms on the private-key file.
- `CryptoKeyGeneratorServiceTest` — Base64 AES-256 shape on first call, never
  overwrites on re-run, `exists()` reports absence then presence.

`IntegrationsHealthService` is tested indirectly through `SetupControllerTest` mocks
— no dedicated unit test today, since its logic is a thin HTTP-client wrapper whose
failure modes are better exercised at the controller boundary.

Frontend coverage is smoke-tested via `bun run typecheck` + `bun run build` + manual
flow verification until a Playwright e2e suite is added (tracked as future work).
